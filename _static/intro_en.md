DESI High is a place where you can carry out your own science experiments and learn about the mysteries of our universe. DESI High‚Äôs online notebooks teach lessons in science and computer programming that will let you experience working with and analyzing real scientific data. Through DESI High, you will become familiar with the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey that is mapping the locations of tens of millions of galaxies in our night sky.

Read on to learn more about the DESI Survey and the science behind it, and then get ready to jump in and begin your own work as a DESI High scientist!

<small>
    ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è DESI High is designed for high school students, but it is also suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well.

### Origins of DESI: The Mystery of Dark Energy
Our universe is expanding. Astronomical observations tell us that the space between galaxies is getting larger over time, while the galaxies themselves stay the same size. This expansion is well understood and is explained by Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity. When the universe started with the Big Bang, it was small, hot, and dense, and it has since expanded up until the present day.

One surprising observation is that the universe's expansion is getting faster. When this accelerating expansion was first discovered in the years 1998 and 1999, we didn't know what was causing it. In fact, we still know very little about the physical cause of the accelerating expansion, which we attribute to a mysterious form of energy called dark energy. Studying and learning more about dark energy is one of the greatest undertakings in modern physics.

### Introduction to DESI
One way that we can study dark energy is by making a giant, three-dimensional map of the universe. The universe's expansion history is encoded in the positions of galaxies. By mapping the distances to millions of galaxies far away from our own, we can learn more about how dark energy has affected the universe's expansion over time.

### Meet the principal
The existence of dark energy was irrefutably confirmed by Lawrence Berkeley Lab's very own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Perlmutter">Saul Perlmutter</a>, Brian Schmidt and Adam Reiss in 1998, when they discovered that the universe's expansion was accelerating. They were awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2011/summary/">Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011</a> for their work.

As honorary principal at DESI High, Saul has a special opening address to all the students, including you!

### How does this work?
To start with DESI High, pick a <i class="has-text-warning">curriculum</i> that interests you. The notebooks will open in <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank">Binder</a> in a new tab. Learn more about the courses, notebooks and how to use them by clicking on the button below. Then, pick a notebook and start exploring the universe!

If you follow this course with a teacher or a DESI High mentor, follow their instructions on how to proceed. Do not hesitate to ask questions and seek help when needed!

ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è If you do not know Python, the <code>Code 101</code> curriculum is a great place to start. It will teach you the basics of Python programming, which is the language we use to analyze data from DESI.
