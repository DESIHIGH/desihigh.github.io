# Curriculums

Curriculums are structured paths to explore our notebooks through various topics related to the DESI project and the study of the universe.
Each curriculum is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a specific topic, with hands-on exercises and practical applications.

Each curriculum is composed of a series of notebooks, which are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations. 
You can run the code directly in your browser using <a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">Binder</a>: just click on the notebook 
and it will open in a new tab, where you can read the content and run the code cells. The notebooks are designed to be interactive, 
so you can experiment with the code and see how it works!

Each curriculum is self-contained, so you can work through the notebooks at your own pace. 
You can also choose to follow the curriculums in a specific order, or pick and choose the notebooks that interest you the most.
A level of difficulty is assigned to each notebook, allowing you to choose the ones that suit your current knowledge and skills.
