# About DESI High

**DESI High** is an outreach initiative that aims to bring the excitement of cosmology and astrophysics to high school students (and older). 
It provides a set of resources, including notebooks, videos, and other educational materials, to help students learn about the universe and the science behind DESI.
By using real DESI data, students can explore the universe, learn how to analyse astronomical data, and develop programming skills.
