The **Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)** is a cosmological survey that aims to map the large-scale structure of the universe and understand the nature of dark energy. It will measure the spectra of millions of galaxies and quasars, that the DESI scientists will analyse to constrain the cosmological models that describe the evolution of the universe.

DESI is a collaboration of scientists and engineers from around the world, working together to build and operate a state-of-the-art spectrograph at the Mayall Telescope in Arizona.
