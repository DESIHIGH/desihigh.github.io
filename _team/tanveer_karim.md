I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto. My research interests are working at the intersection of the cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys, and astrostatistics. I enjoy giving public astro talks and showcasing my love for astronomy and physics with students through programs such as DESI High.
