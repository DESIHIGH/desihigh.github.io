Hi! I am Otávio Alves, a PhD student at the University of Michigan in the United States. I work on calculating the uncertainties of DESI observables (covariance matrices!), which are part of the galaxy clustering analysis. I find great joy in developing interactive tools that allow people to experience science at any level of expertise. Outside of research, I spend my time playing music, reading or designing electronic gadgets.
