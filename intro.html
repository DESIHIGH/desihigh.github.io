            <h3>Origins of DESI: The Mystery of Dark Energy</h3>

            <p>
                Our universe is expanding. Astronomical observations tell us that the space between galaxies is getting larger over time, while the galaxies themselves stay the same size. This expansion is well understood and is explained by Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity. When the universe started with the Big Bang, it was small, hot, and dense, and it has since expanded up until the present day.

                One surprising observation is that the universe's expansion is getting faster. When this accelerating expansion was first discovered in the years 1998 and 1999, we didn't know what was causing it. In fact, we still know very little about the physical cause of the accelerating expansion, which we attribute to a mysterious form of energy called dark energy. Studying and learning more about dark energy is one of the greatest undertakings in modern physics.

            [Introduce Saul Perlmutter and his work here]

            As honorary principal at DESI High, Saul has a special opening address to all the students, including you!

            A welcome to DESI High, Prof. Saul Perlmutter

            The primary motivation for DESI is to repeat similar distant-redshift measurements much more precisely and learn much more about this spooky Dark Energy!
